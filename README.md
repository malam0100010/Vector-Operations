# Vector-Operations
This code can do numerous vector operations including: vector addtion, scalar multiplication, finding the dot product, finding the projection vector, and finding a vector cross product

A new version of this project has been created such that numbers are no longer hard coded but instead read values from user input. 

Output: 

#Vectors can be added component wise to find the addition of two vectors

Vectors used: 

Vector 1: <1, 3>

Vector 2: <-4, 7>

Practice #1: Addition of vectors: 


< -3  4 >

#A scalar multiple can be multiplied to each component of the vector. This portion of the program multiplies each vector by a choosen scalar and then adds them
components wise.

Vectors used: 

Vector A: <1.0, -3.0, 0.0> 

Scalar multiplier for vector A: 5.0

Vector B: <-4.0, 7.0, 5.0>

Scalar multiplier for vector B: 0.5
